### Abstract
Data Mining project carried out on two datasets extracted from the Twitter platform, one on users and one on Tweets. The project consists of data analysis based on data mining tools divided into four tasks:
<br /><br />
Task 1: Data Understanding and Preparation 
Task 1.1: Data Understanding
Explore the dataset with the analytical tools. Evaluate data quality, distribution of variables and pairwise correlations.
Task 1.2: Data Preparation
Improve the quality of the data and prepare them by extracting new interesting features to describe the user and their behaviour from the information gathered from tweets.
<br /><br />
Task 2: Clustering analysis
Based on the userâ€™s profile explore the dataset using various clustering techniques
<br /><br />
Task 3: Predictive Analysis
Consider the problem of predicting for each user the label which is a binary variable that indicates if a user is a bot or a genuine user.
<br /><br />
Task 4: Time Series Analysis
Conduct an analysis of the time series extracted in the year 2019.
